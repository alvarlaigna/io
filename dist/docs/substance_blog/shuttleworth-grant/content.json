We don't want to launch before we are confident that our system is stable and runs reliable when under load. We're working on a bunch of greater refactorings now that we really know what problems we need to solve. We've setup a test suite which allows us to test complex editing scenarios and cover edge cases. We're also stabilizing the API of our core document model. We have some really tough problems to solve, since allowing co-edits combined with offline replication is not trivial. There will be numerous conflict situation the users will have to deal with. In order to support these workflows we need a good versioning API, or in other words, we need something like Git, but optimized for JSON-based documents rather than plain text. So Substance Chronicle was born. It's a git-inspired versioning API based on Operational Transformations (OT). I could talk for hours about this, but I think it's better to get back to work. You can follow Substance development at Github. Please just keep in mind there are still many moving parts and we can't offer support for the time being."
